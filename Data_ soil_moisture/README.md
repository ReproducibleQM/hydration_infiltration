Description (abstract): 
What is your project about?
Measurement of soil moisture properties in response to deep ripping practices for forest restoration.
What is the goal?
Better understanding of remediation practices and mechanisms of restoration

Why are you doing it?
To inform future forest resotration practices in areas with compressed soils
How does this data relate to your project?
It's the moisture content of the soil
